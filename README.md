# WTMGDG-Bambili-100-Days-of-Code-Data-Science
Be able to get some of the concepts python and data science
By the end of this 100 day i will be able to train my own model and test it
#Day 1
Was able to print hello world and try my little if statement
#Day 2
was able to create a variable give it a value hello world and printed it out
#Day 3
Created var placeholders and did arithmetic operations like adding multilpying modulos of two values
#Day 4
**Manipulation in a list** and getting the datatype of each element in the list
#Day 5 
The use of range to access a index of a range of elements in a list. Also using the index number to get the value of the element at that exact postion
#Day 6 
**Sets**. operations in sets (union, intersection etc) modifying sets (updates, add, remove discard, clear)
#Day 7 
**Dictionaries** Accessing Dictionary Values Dictionary Keys vs. List Indices Building a Dictionary Incrementally Restrictions on Dictionary Keys Restrictions on Dictionary Values Operators and Built-in Functions Built-in Dictionary Methods
#Day 8
**If** statement
#Day 9
**Whille** statement
#Day 10
**For loop**, iterations: The process of looping through the objects or items in a collection iterables: An object that can be iterated over, iterator: The object that produces successive items or values from its associated iterable iter(): The built-in function used to obtain an iterator from an iterable
#Day 11
Revision under list and tuple
#Day 12 
Revision of strings, integers, float and complex numbers
#Day 13
**Map** function Pythonâ€™s map() is a built-in function that allows you to process and transform all the items in an iterable without using an explicit for loop, a technique commonly known as mapping. map() is useful when you need to apply a transformation function to each item in an iterable and transform them into a new iterable. map() is one of the tools that support a functional programming style in Python.
#Day 14 
**Functions** function is the relationsip bwn tow or more inputs. we use **def** to define a function with the functions name and the parameter in ()
#Day 15
**input**
#Day 16
**Import** got difficulties on the task
#Day 17
**re module** which is used to search for strings in word and we saw some anchors like the \b \w and also quantifiers
